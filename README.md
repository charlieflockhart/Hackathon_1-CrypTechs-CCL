# Title - CRYP-TECHS 

## Live Site Link
[Live Site](https://charlieflockhart.github.io/Hackathon_1-CrypTechs-CCL/#)

## Brief Introduction
Cryp-Techs is an exciting and challenging word game that puts your puzzle-solving skills to the test. Inspired by the popular Wordle game, Cryp-Techs offers a unique twist with various themes and a festive touch.
Game Overview
Cryp-Techs is designed to be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. Players are tasked with guessing a 5-letter word within six attempts, with feedback provided after each guess to help them get closer to the correct word. The game features different themes like Christmas, food, tech, and more, adding variety and fun to the experience.

How to Play
Start a New Game

Begin by clicking the "New Game" button. A random 5-letter word is selected based on the chosen theme.

Input Your Guess

Type your 5-letter word guess into the input box and press the "Submit" button.

Receive Feedback

After each guess, the game provides feedback:

Green: The letter is correct and in the right position.

Yellow: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.

Gray: The letter is incorrect.

Use this feedback to refine your next guesses.

Hints

If you need assistance, click the "Hint" button to receive a helpful clue. Hints might reveal a correct letter or provide additional context.

Difficulty 

We wanted to add an element to the game for those looking to challenge themselves further. By setting the difficulty to hard, the user only gets 5 guesses (rather than 6) and has a set time to guess the word.

## Agile Methodology 

A project board was set up and the project divided into user stories. 
MosCoW prioritisation was used to prioritise the importance of tasks. 
The project board was used to organise sprints for time management and to keep track of tasks.
The project board can be found here (https://github.com/users/charlieflockhart/projects/5/views/1)

## Design

Our design for Cryp-Techs emphasizes accessibility, simplicity, consistency and responsiveness to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. 
Our aim was to create a sleek, user-friendly website that maintains a cohesive and visually appealing aesthetic. 
The choice of font, the background imagery, and the gameâ€™s name all play into the cryptic and mysterious essence of the game, enhancing the overall immersive experience for our players.
The color scheme for the homepage was centered around the 'cryptic, encrypt, and cryptex' theme. 
For each individual theme of the game, we added a corresponding background image.
